    <h2>What is Machine Learning?</h2>
    <p>Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on developing computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.</p>
    
    <p>The process of learning begins with observations or data, such as examples, direct experience, or instruction, to look for patterns in data and make better decisions in the future based on the examples provided.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Types of Machine Learning</h2>
    <h3>1. Supervised Learning</h3>
    <p>In supervised learning, the algorithm learns from labeled training data. Each training example consists of an input object and a desired output value. The algorithm analyzes the training data and produces an inferred function.</p>
    
    <h3>2. Unsupervised Learning</h3>
    <p>Unsupervised learning algorithms are used when the information used to train is neither classified nor labeled. The system tries to learn without a teacher, exploring the data to find patterns.</p>
    
    <h3>3. Reinforcement Learning</h3>
    <p>Reinforcement learning is about taking suitable action to maximize reward in a particular situation. It is employed by various software and machines to find the best possible behavior or path in a specific situation.</p>

    <h2>Applications of Machine Learning</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Image Recognition:</strong> Identifying objects, persons, places, and digital images</li>
      <li><strong>Speech Recognition:</strong> Converting speech into text (speech-to-text)</li>
      <li><strong>Medical Diagnosis:</strong> Predicting diseases and assisting in treatment decisions</li>
      <li><strong>Financial Services:</strong> Credit scoring, algorithmic trading, fraud detection</li>
      <li><strong>Recommendation Systems:</strong> Suggesting products, movies, or content based on user preferences</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
    <p><strong>Training Data:</strong> The dataset used to train the machine learning model. Quality and quantity of training data significantly impact model performance.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Features:</strong> Individual measurable properties or characteristics of the data being observed. Feature selection and engineering are crucial for model success.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Model:</strong> The mathematical representation of patterns discovered in the data. Different algorithms produce different types of models.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Overfitting:</strong> When a model learns the training data too well, including noise and outliers, resulting in poor performance on new data.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Cross-validation:</strong> A technique to assess how well a model generalizes to unseen data by partitioning the available data.</p>

    <h2>Testing Instructions</h2>
    <p>This page is designed to test the Ambient Anki extension. It contains educational content about machine learning that should generate good flashcards.</p>
    
    <ol>
      <li>Make sure Anki is running with AnkiConnect addon</li>
      <li>Configure your API key in the extension settings</li>
      <li>Click the extension icon and press "Capture Current Page"</li>
      <li>Review the generated flashcards and add them to Anki</li>
    </ol>
